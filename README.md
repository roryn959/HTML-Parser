# HTML Parser

A coursework project to create programs in both C and Haskell to parse an HTML file, and output whether the file uses valid syntax or not.

> To run the C code, navigate to the folder 'C'. Enter some html code into 'file.html' and run 'main.c' to have the html parsed.

> To run the Haskell code, navigate to the folder 'Haskell'. Enter some html code into 'file.html'. There are two Haskell files - both will perform the same function but are implemented in a different style. Run either to have the html parsed.
